# JavaScript_Calculator
This will be a calculator implemented in JavaScript with the UI set up in html/CSS. My goal is to implement as many of the basic functions of your typical calculator as possible. This project will help me further develop my skills in JavaScript, html and CSS.

After completion of this project, I learned to be comfortable with using the browser dev-tools to debug and experiment. Without being able to use 'console.log' to see what my code is actually doing, it would have been much more difficult to implement many of the ideas I had during this project.
